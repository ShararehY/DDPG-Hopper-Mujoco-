# DDPG-Hopper-Mujoco-
Implementation of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient on Hopper environment of Mujoco

MuJoCo is a general purpose physics engine that aims to facilitate research and development in robotics. It stands for Multi-Joint dynamics with contact. Mujoco has different environments from which I use Hopper. Hopper has a 11-dimensional state space, that is position and velocity of each joint. The initial states are uniformly randomized. The action is a 3-dimensional continuous space. This environment is terminated when the agent falls down.
